            <h3>Autarky</h3>
            <h6>Detroit Rebirth/ Vertical Farm</h6>
            <h5>Integrated Farm Reviving The City</h5>
            <p>Since the 1990s, Detroit has been confronted with multiple dilemmas. To revive the city, the project intends to bring new jobs, more incomes, and fresh foods to residents in an agricultural way, and also to design for the quality of life of cultivated animals and plants.</p>
            <h5>Flowing Plates, Twisted Tubes</h5>
            <p>All geometries in the cube compose a farm full of adventure. Spirally rising floors eliminate vertical separation and extend spaces upwards and downwards. Twisted tubes provide unique passages for transporting and independent planting.</p>

            <h3>Electric Current</h3>
            <h6>Factory Adaptive Reuse</h6>
            <h5>Vitality</h5>
            <p>The adaptive reuse project transformed an abandoned factory into a kindergarten. As some elderly people and children are left behind in this fringe area, the project aims to inject vitality into the site.</p>
            <h5>Yellow Passages</h5>
            <p>Streets are extented into the factory and endowed with varied forms, which combine together becoming a yellow passage system. The linear element meantime represents cables used to be produced in the factory so that the memory would resonate among surrounding residents.</p>

            <h3>Tide</h3>
            <h6>Module Aggregation/ Green Hotel</h6>
            <h5>Setbacks vs. Privacy</h5>
            <p>Setbacks enable guests to enjoy terraces in their own rooms, which, yet at the same time, means that privacy is not guaranteed. To combat the flaw, slabs are transformed and combined with planting. Not only privacy is protected, the partial height of the room is increased, thus bringing a wider view.</p>
            <h5>Module</h5>
            <p>The design is composed of several modules, which consist of terrace, shading components, planters alongside the other basic equipment. Through aggregation and variation, the design is a rhythmic and flexible design conforming to the aesthetics and context requirements.</p>

            <h6>Urban Circulation/ Residential Design</h6>
            <h5>Flowing Crowds</h5>
            <p>I consider the crowds flowing and gathering  in the community as cells, and use the biological structure to plan the overall residential area. With large geometric masses with cutting triangles urban roads, squares and internal streets are systemetically organized into a highly vibrant and dynamic neighborhood.</p>
            <h5>Elevated Public Garden</h5>
            <p>To accommodate more greenery in the limited urban space, the public garden is elevated to the middle level as an overhead new landscape so that people can fully enjoy social life and urban view.</p>

            <p>There are various seating choices suitable for assorted scenarios, such as office chairs, conference chairs, recliners, etc. However, this chair can cover all daily needs for sitting. By flipping it, a new piece of furniture can be obtained, which brings some uncertainty to the space.</p>

            <h6>Light Design</h6>
            <h5>Flickering Fire</h5>
            <p>The light shell takes the inspiration from fire -- the most primitive lighting resource. The dynamic form creates an illusion of flickering of flame swaying in the gentle blow, which brings about vitality, warmth and passion to the darkness.</p>

            <h5>Clay "Fabric"</h5>
            <p>The vase made of dried clay features hard texture, but the design trys to fulfill the material a soft sense of feeling by integrating the fashion element, peplum, into the form. After manipulating details, the vase becomes a miniature of skirt.</p>
